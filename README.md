# Record Idea

**Description:**

The **Record Idea** project was created for people who have many ideas and donâ€™t know where to record them for future reference. The project allows for the creation and categorization of ideas, making it easier to manage and organize your inspirations.

## Technologies and Patterns

The project uses the following technologies and patterns:

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used to store categories and ideas.
- **.NET:** Framework used for application development.
- **Swagger:** Tool for API documentation and testing.

**Patterns:**

- **Result Pattern:** Used to return results and error messages consistently.
- **Repository Pattern:** Implemented to encapsulate data access and promote separation of concerns.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Applied to separate read and write operations, improving scalability and maintainability of the application.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you need to install some dependencies and set up MongoDB:

1. Install the following dependencies:
    - `MongoDB.Driver`
    - `MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`
2. Install and configure MongoDB on your machine.

## Usage

1. **Run the project:** Execute the command `dotnet watch run` to start the server. This will open a Swagger page in your browser.

2. **Register a category:**
    - Access the category registration endpoint on Swagger.
    - In the request body of the POST category registration, the `id` property will be auto-filled if there are no existing records. It is recommended to create the ID via MongoDB.
    - Provide the name and description of the category.

3. **Register an idea:**
    - Access the idea registration endpoint on Swagger.
    - In the request body, the `ID` field functions similarly to the category ID and can be left blank.
    - Fill in the title and description of the idea.
    - Enter the ID of the corresponding category already created. The category name will be registered automatically.
    - The creation date and time will be generated automatically.

## Future Implementations

The following features are planned for future development:

- **User Class Creation:** Implement a user class for managing new user registrations.
- **User Authentication:** Add functionality for user authentication to secure access to the application.
- **Frontend Application:** Develop a frontend for user interaction with the application, enhancing usability and providing a user-friendly interface.
